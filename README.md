"Corey's Own Task Manager App"

The goal of this project is to create a task managaer for my own use using Python (Django). Looking to gain a deeper exposure to Django and have a first project which utilizes Javascript. No deadline or end result is planned, only with the goal in mind of developing this tool for my own use until I find it suites my needs and have learned enough from it as I'd like.
